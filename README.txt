== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the right way to use a shortcode? =

The right way to use a shortcode is as follows: 
[wp360view product_id = XX]
Replace the mentioned product_id value with your product_id value.

= How can I set the frame rate and speed of rotation for my product? =

You can update the frame rate and speed of rotation of your product from: WooCommerce > Settings > 360 View Settings

= Why my product’s animation did not start loading? =

To start loading your product’s animation you need to make sure you have enabled JavaScript in your browser. JavaScript errors or duplicate jQuery scripts loaded on your webpage can hinder your product animation.

= Can I display multiple 360 views on one page? =

Sure! With the help of shortcodes, you can add as many views as you want. It's easy!

= When I attempt to drag or play the view, it plays too quickly. How to fix it? =

The product may seem to play fast if you add only a few pictures. We highly recommend using at least 36 images with one image per 10° for smooth animation. 

= How to set globally or override various settings like: navigation, dragging, spinning, cursor showing, enabling full screen, and Zooming In/Out?  =

The shortcodes to perform these settings are:
Navigation > [wp360view product_id = xx navigation = "true"]
Dragging > [wp360view product_id = xx drag = "true"]
Spinning > [wp360view product_id = xx enablespin = "true"]
Cursor showing > [wp360view product_id = xx showcursor= "false"]
Enabling full screen > [wp360view product_id = xx fullscreen = "true"]
Zooming in/out > [wp360view product_id = xx zoominout = "true"]

= How to set globally or override various multiple settings like: navigation, dragging, spinning, cursor showing, enabling full screen, and Zooming In/Out? =

The shortcode to perform these setting is:
[wp360view product_id = XX showcursor= "false" enablespin = "true" …. ]

= What is causing the product image to not function properly when used on WooCommerce? =

Your WooCommerce theme may have a custom product image template that overrides the default image hook. We have a small code snippet to fix this issue. Please contact us using the “Contact Author” button given below, to access it.
